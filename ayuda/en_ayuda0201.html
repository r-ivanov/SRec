<font face="Arial">

<P>To be able to generate new visualizations, it is necessary to process the Java class that contains the algorithm that we want to visualize. This process, which just takes a few seconds, allows to the application to generate a alternative Java code that includes the necessary sentences for the creation of a structure that will contain the trace of the execution. To initiate the process, the option <b>File / Process class...</B> must be selected.</P>

<P>The aim of the trace is to store all the recursive calls that are realized during the selected algorithm running, together with the values of the parameters and the return value.</P>

<P>After a first analysis of the selected Java class, SRec shows a list of available methods for their using. User has to select the methods he wants to use after the class load. For each method, user has to select the design technique under it was designed, recursion or "Divide and conquer". In the second case, user has to write the number of the parameter that contains the data structure and the number of the parameters that delimit the part of the data structure trated by the algorythm in each subcall. After this, the load finishes.</p>

<P>Methods that do not have any in parameter, have as parameter or value of return arrays of any more than two dimensions or not primitive types are not methods visualizables. Neither will be able to be runned methods declared inside an abstract class.</P>

<P>From then, so many visualizations will be able to be generated with the processed methods.</P>
