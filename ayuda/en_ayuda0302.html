<font face="Arial">

<P>The application gives the possibility of choosing between supporting previous steps information in the visualization or in being attenuating it or eliminating it. The <A HREF = "en_ayuda0303.html">format</A> in that the attenuated values appear is configurable for the user.</P>

<P>On the other hand, the application allows to choose between showing the subcalls that are generated when a jump occurs on the present call, or not to show the generated subtree. This tree will be as long as the current configuration does not eliminate of the visualization the historical nodes. </P>

<P>In order to change these configurations it is necessary to select to the option <B>Configuration / Animation options</B> and to select in the second panel the wished action about the historical values. The changes will take place immediately in the visualization. Once "<i>Aceptar</i>" is pressed the dialogue picture will disappear maintaining the configuration chosen. </P>
