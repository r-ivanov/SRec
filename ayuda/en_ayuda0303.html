The mode distinguishes between in values and out valores, so cells with in values will be colored in a different color that cells with out values. Second of the tabs manages the modo 2 of color. This mode colours nodes according to the method what they belong to, so nodes of one method are colored with different color that nodes of other methods. The third tab allows to configure the color for the background, edges, frames and others elements.</P>
